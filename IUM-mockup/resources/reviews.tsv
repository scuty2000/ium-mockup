10	2	2021-05-10	awedPaella9	Thought it was better	It's mostly very basic stuff, but even then it introduced me to concepts I wasn't aware of.	3	318	362

16	3	2021-09-16	insecureMussel0	WOW	Topics related to the economy or business are not something I am good at or enjoy reading about, this course helped me learn a bunch of useful things I would otherwise not have put effort into studying.	4	83	121
17	3	2021-07-16	lazyCockatoo1	Interesting	This is a very basic course on 3D Printing Technology but every aspect of the technology is artistically explained. All the various points of view are considered and a 360 degree idea is passed on to the students.By taking this course, students who are contemplating about their involvement in this revolutionary technology will be able to finally decide their future course of action, which I believe will be positive.In short, this course will provide you a base whereas the further courses, I think (as I haven't taken up the rest of the courses till now but I intend to) will add sufficient value to your knowledge.Regards.	3	446	314
18	3	2021-12-31	murkySyrup9	Should be improved	This is the first English course I have taken.Though at first it was kind of difficulty because of language(especially the terms) and profession knowledge(it is a comprehensive course and I am still learning courses concerned at school)the course is really worth taking.

37	6	2022-01-11	selfishApples0	Prepeare yourself for this agony	I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.	2	220	311

42	7	2021-08-10	forsakenRelish9	Very interesting	Great working examples to learn Analytics in Financial Statement Analysis. Pace of videos was great. Working excel worksheet gives perfect hands on experience to vary and run the scenarios. Having done "Introduction to Financial Accounting" by same professor gave little bit more visibility into reading statements and understanding ratio analysis.Virtual Classroom is getting more new students in each course. I am looking forward to Advance Financial Accounting course.	4	344	9

44	8	2021-05-31	sugaryHeron0	Good course	I am very glad to see courses like this one on Homework Heroes. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Homework Heroes already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only £32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!	4	441	446
45	8	2021-08-15	jealousSeafowl9	Interesting	It was exactly like the lecturer said it would be like.The only hard part is the last part, where we had to actually remix an existing 3D model .I think this part of the lecturer video should have had an in depth look at how to use the 3D app.Nevertheless the course was good I learnt a lot of new stuff and not to give out any spoilers.....Its worth it.	3	288	81

56	10	2021-10-07	anxiousChowder8	Not bad	I believe that it is a fantastic course for those have some basic accounting knowledge and the willingness to enter compliance area.

66	12	2021-04-08	emptyLard0	Should be improved	The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.	3	363	350
67	13	2021-08-01	crushedCurlew4	Interesting	Awesome Course! Very funny and really sophisticated! The last part is eye opening. Best course in this specialisation!It is not for beginners though, you should have a solid understanding of accounting for the first 3 lectures.	3	158	476

76	14	2021-09-04	solidToucan8	Should be improved	I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The "First Course" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The "Second Course" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.	3	166	457
77	14	2021-02-18	gloomyMoth7	Should be improved	it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.	3	32	87

82	15	2021-08-05	morbidJaguar8	WOW	I really liked The 3D Printing Revolution course. It's easy to understand, you don't need any background knowledge, but you will find out so much about this topic - including materials that are used, technologies, 3D printing companies... Also, the materials cover history and the future of 3D printing. It's a great introductory course and the instructor (and the guests) are amazing. I recommend it!	5	26	309
